                Distributed Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   Distributed HTTP is a form of HTTP mediated by caching proxies
   that speak a common protocol to one another. This is
   implemented through the relationships between domains, resources
   and revisions.

   Instances of compatible proxies respect a routing topology based
   on Kademlia with free node ID generation seeded by the nodes' IP
   address, port number and public RSA key.

   All revision objects have an associated SHA1 hash to be used as
   their identifier.
   
   Stored resources may optionally be made public where their original
   URL is SHA1 hashed and used as a Kademlia node ID. The corresponding
   node is then searched for and informed that you are willing and able
   to serve data corresponding to the content hash for the resource
   in question.
   
   Distributed trust computation is discussed further on.

1 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

   Distributed HTTP is set of fundamental principles for peer-to-peer
   networks sharing Hyptermedia resources amongst nodes engaging in
   shared overlay network namespaces, making HTTP resistant to server
   downtime, domain name forfeiture and optionally, dedicated servers.

1.2 Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [34].

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
   level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said
   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
   level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its
   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

1.3 Terminology

   This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   played by participants in, and objects of, Distributed HTTP networks.

   instance
      An instance of a distributed HTTP proxy that implements 
      and supports this protocol.

   peer node
      The local perspective of a remote instance.

   overlay network
      A routing table containing references to known peer nodes.

   message
      The basic unit of distributed HTTP communication which may consist
      of references to known peer nodes in order to passively reinforce
      the routing topology.

   RPC
      Remote Procedure Call.
      A local procedure called from a remote instance.

   node ID
      A 160-bit binary value.
      Free node ID generation MUST be limited to the SHA1 hash of an
      instances' public IP address, port number and public RSA
      key. This prevents users from obtaining node IDs that can permit
      the collection of valuable usage data for a URL of interest.

   APPEND
      The APPEND RPC uses the SHA1 hash of a URL or hypermedia object
      and uses this as a node ID, contacting the node in question or
      neighbouring nodes and appending a reference to our own instance,
      indicating we will serve data that corresponds to the given
      content hash.

   FIND
      FIND procedure calls indicate lookups for a given SHA1 hash by
      using it as a node ID and asking peers 

2 Routing Topology

2.1 Overlay networks as described by Kademlia (2002)

   https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf

        Secure Node ID generation
        Kademlia via JSON over HTTP/1.1
        Kademlia with ProtoBufs over HTTP/2 or QUIC. Bytestreams.
        Routing table reinforcement
        Multiple routing tables
        Trust-based table selection

3 Collaborative Editing

    RPC_EDIT
    fragment, document
    tree reintegration
    Inter-instance RPC_EDIT
    Edited revisions in overlay networks

4 Distributed Trust

4.1 
   www.cc.gatech.edu/~lingliu/papers/2012/XinxinFan-EigenTrust++.pdf

        Preemptively detecting malicious peers with P and EP.

5 Attribution and Licensing

5.1 Introducing the license attribute

   "Information wants to be free. Information also wants to be
   expensive." -- Stewart Brand
   
   A REQUIRED safeguard for protecting the livelihoods of economic
   producers is the recognition of a "license" attribute when
   referencing copywritten hypermedia objects.
   
   E.G.
   <img src="/portfolio_item.png" license="Copyright Site. Owner 2016" />
   SHALL cause instances to either omit retrieval or demarcate the object
   as unpublicizable to network peers, whereas
    <img src="/vacation_photo.png" license="CC BY" />
   SHALL NOT.
