####NOTE

As of 12/3/18 this project is on haitus due to perceived deficiencies with the proposed protocol.

We're currently on the lookout for a way to ascribe trust ratings to content without stripping ordinary users of their privacy while browsing.

#####Pulling a resource from a peer

The DHT is automatically queried when resources can't be retrieved from their canonical URL.


Visit :8080/v1/peers/test to tell peers you're serving whatever revision is found first.

Visit :8090/v1/peers/url_for_revision to pull the resource through the first peer and serve with the second peer.

Currently a work-in-progess as RPCs undergo refinement.
