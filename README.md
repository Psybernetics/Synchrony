Installation:
<pre>
sudo python setup.py install
synchrony --help
synchrony --debug
</pre>
From another shell:
<pre>
synchrony --debug --port 8090 --bootstrap localhost:8080
</pre>

Visit localhost:8080 in a browser, make an account, hover over the scaled fish icon and
pull in http://news.ycombinator.com.

If you repeat this process from another browser window you should be able to edit the page collaboratively.

#####Pulling a resource from a peer

Visit :8080/v1/peers/test to tell peers you're serving whatever revision is found first.

Visit :8090/v1/peers/url_for_revision to pull the resource through the first peer and serve with the second peer.

Currently a work-in-progess as RPCs undergo refinement.
